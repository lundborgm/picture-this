## Code review

By [Jakob Fridmar](https://github.com/JakobClausen)

* Good structure to in the code. 
* Upload directory did not upload due to ignored in .gitignore. therefore there was no place for my images to go when I used the site.
* Impressed with thought where everything is liked together with minimal code. Like putting autoload in the header. 
* Good with confirmation if form request was successful or not. 
* Simple and easy to follow CSS
* You can’t change the description of a post without changing the picture. 

Good job!
